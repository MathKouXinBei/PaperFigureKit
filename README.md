Correlation Circle Matrix Plotting Tool
A lightweight Python tool for generating high-quality scientific figures, visualizing the correlation matrix using circle size and color.  
Suitable for paper figure reproduction, exploratory data analysis, and educational use.
## Features
- Circle size is proportional to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient
- Color map reflects positive/negative correlations using the 'coolwarm' scheme
- Annotated values displayed at the center of each circle
- Grid lines help with visual alignment and clarity
- Supports saving as high-resolution images (PNG)
- Works with both NumPy arrays and pandas DataFrames
